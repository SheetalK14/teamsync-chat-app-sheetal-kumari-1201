# TeamSync Chat App

## Project Overview

**TeamSync Chat App** is a lightweight web-based communication platform for teams to collaborate efficiently. It integrates an AI assistant that summarizes daily discussions and suggests actionable follow-ups, reducing information overload and improving productivity. The app supports real-time messaging, file sharing, and AI-driven insights for smarter team coordination.

---

## Problem Statement

In modern workplaces, teams struggle to keep track of discussions across multiple chat threads, leading to lost information and missed action items. Manual summarization is time-consuming and often incomplete. **TeamSync Chat App** addresses this problem by providing an AI-powered chat platform that organizes conversations, generates daily summaries, and highlights key tasks, helping teams stay aligned and save valuable time.

* Send real-time messages and share files.
* Automatically generate daily summaries of discussions.
